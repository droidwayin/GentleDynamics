## 🥹 Introduction (Music Preset)
This EasyEffects preset uses psychoacoustic principles to enhance your music listening experience. It features an 8-band multiband compressor (MBC) aligned with human hearing (Bark scale) for natural sound improvement on both headphones and speakers.

This preset uses scientifically-backed principles to enhance your listening experience:  

- **Bark Scale Alignment**: 8 frequency bands matching human auditory perception
- **Automatic Calibration**: Self-adjusting to your audio content
- **Time Constant Optimization**: Attack/release times match neural processing speeds  
- **Upward Compression**: Boosts quiet details without making loud sounds harsh  
- **Dynamic Effect**: Multiband compression creates natural tonal balance  
- **Phase Coherence**: Preserves spatial cues and instrument positioning  

## 🎚️ Sound Improvements:

- **Sub-bass (20-100Hz):** Physical rumble without distortion, no boominess
- **Bass (100-200Hz):** Tight and controlled foundation
- **Mid-range (200-3200Hz):** Natural vocal and instrument clarity
- **Highs (3200Hz+):** Detailed brilliance without harshness
- **Soundstage:** Expanded width and depth with precise imaging
- **Volume Independence:** Maintains clarity and definition even at lower listening volumes

⚠️ **Usage Notes**  
Start with **-6 dB** system volume when first enabling.  
Allow **48 hours** for your brain to fully adapt to the new sound stage.

## 📻 GentleDynamics Feather Loudness V4 (Gentler and Sweeter Preset for Music ❤️‍🩹)

Whether you’re working, relaxing, or listening to music, this preset gives you a smooth, polished sound, like a high-quality FM broadcast or premium car audio system. It works superbly to bring life to generic headphones or to add a final layer of professional sheen to headphones with AutoEQ-corrected profiles. You may also pair it with an external amplifier and speakers to achieve that full, impactful sound.

>This preset aims for a gentle lift in loudness, not heavy boosting. Toggle the compressor on/off to hear the difference, or use the bypass button in EasyEffects to compare the full effect. Start 10 points below your usual volume.<br><br> Place your AutoEQ headset correction profile (if you have any) **after** the MBC: <br>Source → [18Hz EQ Filter] → [8-Band MBC] → **[Your AutoEQ Profile]** → [Compressor] → [Limiter] → Output <br><br> ⋆.˚🦋༘⋆

## 🎬 GentleDynamics Dialogue Clarity Engine (Movie) 🗣️

This preset employs surgical compression techniques to solve the common problem of fluctuating dialogue levels in modern movies. Unlike traditional loudness normalization that raises the entire volume, often exaggerating noise and crushing impactful sounds, this chain works intelligently without using AutoGain. 

This preset ensures the dialogue is always clear, while respecting the dynamics and impact of the original soundtrack. You get consistent, ***intelligible speech*** closer to EBU R 128 standards.

🔊 **Set your volume based on the loudest moments, at a moderate level where it isn't overwhelming for you.** Dialogue will remain clear and easy to hear, even in movies like Dune or Tenet, where quiet whispers contrast with loud action scenes.

**Headphone Correction Howto**:
If you are using an AutoEQ profile, place it above the limiter plugin. A -4 dB gain reduction is already applied at the third compressor. If your AutoEQ profile requires additional preamp reduction, apply only the difference at the AutoEQ correction plugin. For example, if the AutoEQ profile calls for a -6 dB preamp reduction, set -2 dB at the AutoEQ correction plugin. Make sure Autogain is off.

## 👀 The Difference Between Profiles (Music)

### **GentleDynamics**
- Focused on **pure, uncolored dynamic restoration** and **clarity**
- For transparent, high-fidelity listening that preserves the original dynamics and intent of your music.

### **GentleDynamics Feather Loudness**
- Builds upon the original profile  
- Lifts loudness for a more impactful and consistent *"commercial-grade"* sound  
- Ideal for **casual and extended listening sessions**

## ⋆.˚✮🎧✮˚.⋆ For Headphone Users (Important)
Place your AutoEQ headset correction profile (if you have any) **after** the MBC:<br><br>
Source → [18Hz EQ Filter] → [8-Band MBC] → **[Your AutoEQ Profile]** → [Limiter] → Output

**Why This Order Matters**

- The MBC needs to analyze the original recording dynamics
- Headphone correction changes frequency response, which would alter how the MBC processes sound
- Placing correction after MBC preserves spatial cues and dynamic processing integrity

Your headphones get the full benefit of psychoacoustic processing.

2. Toggle MBC on/off while listening
3. Notice these changes:

| Aspect              | With MBC Enabled                                | With MBC Disabled                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Bass Detail         | ✅ Deeper but tighter                           | Less defined, more blended             |
| Vocal Clarity       | ✅ Enhanced clarity, more intelligible words    | Slightly muffled                       |
| Cymbal Decay        | ✅ Smoother high-frequency decay                | Highs may sound dull or sharp, Quicker fade-out  |
| Background Details  | ✅ Subtle elements more audible                 | Harder to distinguish                  |
| Overall Fatigue     | ✅ Less listening fatigue                       | More fatigue at high volumes           |

> Note: The difference is often perceived as "removing a thin veil" rather than dramatic change. Your brain may initially interpret it as slightly quieter but clearer sound.

**Why Some Songs Show Minimal or No Change?**  
This preset reveals existing quality rather than adding effects. You'll notice:  

- **Responds to source material:** Well-recorded tracks show less change  
- **Focuses on deficiencies:** Only enhances masked frequencies  
- **Avoids over-processing:** Never adds artificial effects  
- **Prioritizes dynamics:** Changes are more apparent in dynamic passages  

**Volume-Independent Clarity**  
This preset maintains exceptional clarity even at lower volumes by:  

- Enhancing subtle details often masked at quiet levels  
- Balancing frequency response dynamically  
- Preserving spatial cues regardless of volume  
- Optimizing the ear's sensitivity curve

**To see real-time MBC processing in EasyEffects:**

1. Go to **Preferences → Experimental Features**.
2. Enable **Native Plugin Window**.
3. In the MBC plugin, click **Show Native Window** to view the real-time processing.
> Tip: In the LSP MBC window, use the **Zoom** slider (to the right of the graph) and drag it all the way down and maximize the window to see detailed band movements.

**Why This Matters:**

- **Headphones:** Without AutoEQ, differences are more obvious because you hear the MBC enhancing your headphones' natural response  
- **Speakers:** Benefits rooms by controlling resonances and improving clarity  
- **Brain Adaptation:** Effects become more natural sounding after 15–60 minutes of listening

## ִֶָ𓂃 ࣪˖ ִֶָ🐇་༘࿐ Brain Interpretation

When enabling MBC, you'll experience:

- **0–15 seconds:** Subtle "cleaning" effect 
- **15–60 seconds:** Perceived clarity enhancement 
- **1+ minute:** Natural immersion as brain accepts enhanced spatial cues

Disabling MBC will reveal:

*brain working harder more to follow music*

- Flatter dynamic range 
- Reduced spatial depth
- Less defined frequency balance

⚠️ Allow **48 hours** for your brain to fully adapt to the new sound stage.

## 🧠 Fatigue Reduction
This preset uses precision-timed processing (tau values) that match how your brain processes sound.
The MBC significantly reduces listening fatigue during long sessions because:

→ Compression timing matches neural processing speeds<br>
→ Transients arrive in sync across frequencies<br>
→ No timing conflicts to mentally resolve<br>
→ Upward compression gently reveals details (no harsh boosting)<br>
→ Downward compression prevents "frequency fatigue" in critical ranges<br>
→ Consistent dynamics prevent subconscious straining to hear<br>

Result: Music feels more natural to follow, with less ear fatigue.

## 🥺 **The Final Truth**  
This isn't EQ – it's dynamic range optimization using hearing science. Like cleaning a window.  
The result? Your music sounds more like itself – just clearer, more balanced, and easier to enjoy for hours.  
No magic, just science.
