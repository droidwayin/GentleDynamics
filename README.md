## üåü Introduction
This EasyEffects preset uses psychoacoustic principles to enhance your audio experience. It features an 8-band multiband compressor (MBC) aligned with human hearing (Bark scale) for natural sound improvement on both headphones and speakers.

This preset uses scientifically-backed principles to enhance your listening experience:  

- **Bark Scale Alignment**: 8 frequency bands matching human auditory perception  
- **Time Constant Optimization (œÑ)**: Attack/release times match neural processing speeds  
- **Upward Compression**: Boosts quiet details without making loud sounds harsh  
- **Dynamic Effect**: Multiband compression creates natural tonal balance  
- **Phase Coherence**: Preserves spatial cues and instrument positioning  

## üéöÔ∏è What This Preset Does
Bass: Full but controlled (no boominess)<br>
Vocals: Clear and natural<br>
Highs: Detailed but not harsh<br>
Soundstage: Wider and spatial

## üéß For Headphone Users (Important)
Place your AutoEQ headset correction profile **after** the MBC:<br>
Source ‚Üí [25Hz EQ Filter] ‚Üí [8-Band MBC] ‚Üí [Your AutoEQ Profile] ‚Üí [Limiter] ‚Üí Output

- Let psychoacoustic processing enhance your headphones' natural response  
- Prevent EQ corrections from being altered by compression  
- Maintain precise frequency correction  

Your headphones get the full benefit of psychoacoustic processing

## üß† Fatigue Reduction - Brain-Friendly Time Constants
This preset uses precision-timed processing (tau values) that match how your brain processes sound.
The MBC significantly reduces listening fatigue during long sessions because:

‚Üí Compression timing matches neural processing speeds<br>
‚Üí Transients arrive in sync across frequencies<br>
‚Üí No timing conflicts to mentally resolve<br>
‚Üí Upward compression gently reveals details (no harsh boosting)<br>
‚Üí Downward compression prevents "frequency fatigue" in critical ranges<br>
‚Üí Consistent dynamics prevent subconscious straining to hear<br>

Result: Music feels more natural to follow, with less ear fatigue.
